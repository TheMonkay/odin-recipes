This folfer contains my first attempt to create a website containing multiple links to different vietnamese recipes.
It is the 17th day of August in 2022. I am learning to code in my free time as an english teacher in Boun ma thuot, Vietnam.

First time using github. No idea how to do it but will figure it out.

The website is first developed with HTML for basic structure later on css will jump in to do stuff. I dont know what it does yet,
will find out later. 

The index(home) page will contain a list of links and photos of to recipes. Hopefully accurate recipes. 

Let the creativity Commence!
